            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Breaking News! Ontario high school students have been found to
              have the lowest student performance outcomes in decades and is
              currently 30% below the national average. This is a provincial
              emergency. Premier Doug Ford and his cabinet are looking for
              change, particularly in switching up classroom sizes. We have
              invited those most affected by the proposed policy changes here
              today to discuss if classroom size matters in relation to student
              outcomes amongst secondary students. First, we have Lucy Smith who
              has done profound research on its impact on students’ test scores:

            <h3>Educational Economist (Lucy Smith), Argument: Test Scores</h3>
            <p>
              For both traditional and online secondary schools, I believe that
              class size matters. Following Maimonides’ rule of 40, researchers
              have found that smaller class sizes are correlated with more
              chances of score manipulation by teachers. In a study set in
              Italy, it is found that teachers are more likely to manipulate
              standardized tests, specifically dishonest transcription of
              handwritten answer sheets onto machine-readable score report forms
              when there is a lack of social constraint by peers. This behaviour
              is even more likely to occur in areas where there are weak worker
              performance standards set in place. On the other hand, in a four
              year national study in the U.S., smaller high school classroom
              sizes were a significant predictor for student’s strong college
              science performances and led to higher adult earnings. However, it
              is well documented that as schools shift to an online setting our
              pre-existing knowledge of how class size affects student grades
              also changes. Researchers showed a statistically significant
              result for science, math, social science and art classes, a trend
              in which final grades increased as class sizes increased in an
              online learning environment, with the optimal online class size
              occurring around 35-42 students. So, if Ford wants to better the
              school system, I believe he should highly consider changing up
              classes as suggested as smaller class sizes lead to higher test
              scores and earning potential in an in-person classroom but they
              have to be careful to implement restrictions in order to avoid
              score manipulation by teachers. But if social distancing is still
              a major contributing factor and there’s a need for online
              classrooms, larger classrooms are suggested as that leads to
              higher student achievement..

            <h3>
              Politician From Opposing Party (Andrea Horwath), Argument: Test
              Scores
            </h3>
            <p>
              In 2002, in Seoul, South Korea, a large-scale class size reduction
              policy was implemented in secondary schools. Researchers found
              that the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) scores for the
              years prior to the CSR and following the CSR had very little
              change despite any factors that may have influenced grades such as
              students changing schools or teachers taking a few years to adjust
              their curriculum to better accommodate the new class size. There
              was also no significant change among low socioeconomic students’
              grades and since almost every high school student in Seoul takes
              the CSAT, whether they attend college or not, it is evident that
              class size does not matter in secondary school. Ford should not be
              placing his focus on changing high school classroom sizes but
              rather focus on other factors that may be impacting these low
              scores. For instance, an emphasis on the educators teaching these
              students would be a better use of his resources as they have the
              largest and most direct impact on them.

            <h3>Researcher (Penelope Brown), ARGUMENT: STUDENT BEHAVIOUR</h3>
            <p>
              Ford’s focus on class size is vital to improving high school
              students’ grades. My colleagues and I recently conducted a study
              on the effects of class size reduction on secondary students in
              England and found that although students who were performing well
              in school prior to any class size reduction were not impacted by
              the change, low attainment students had significant improvement in
              their performance as they spent more time on-task when in smaller
              class sizes compared to more time off-task when in larger class
              sizes. The substantial effect of a class size reduction on low
              attainment students’ grades would thus improve overall high school
              student grades. To support this, one of the students who was part
              of this research, Nancy, has joined me to discuss her results when
              her class sizes reduced.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h3>Student (Nancy Scott), ARGUMENT: STUDENT BEHAVIOUR</h3>
            <p>
              I fully agree that Ford should be focusing on class size to
              improve student grades. Personally, whenever I’m in larger
              classes, I have a harder time focusing and don’t perform as well
              as I do in smaller class sizes where I can have more one-on-one
              time with my teachers. I find that this is true for me and all my
              friends who already have a hard time in class as we tend to get
              more distracted in larger class sizes. Since it’s important to be
              inclusive, having smaller classes, even if it does not benefit
              students who perform well in larger classes, would benefit
              students like me which in turn would raise the average student
              grades since we’re being the most heavily affected by the large
              class sizes.

            <h3>Teacher (Susan Susanna), ARGUMENT: OTHER FACTORS</h3>
            <p>
              I’m not saying high school class sizes don't matter, but it plays
              such a miniscule part in impacting student outcomes, and is
              definitely not what the Ford government’s educational policy
              changes should focus on. Research has shown that how school system
              inputs are used matter much more than the amount of school inputs.
              This means things like instruction time and how different
              resources are implemented in the classroom are significantly more
              important than class size in high school. It’s about how well a
              student is engaged, not how many students there are. And this is
              simply things within the school that we have control over. Every
              student is different, comes from different familial, cultural, and
              socio-economic backgrounds. They have different histories and
              upbringings, which is all going to affect their education. These
              are all factors that are going to impact student performance, and
              these factors aren’t going to change because a student has less or
              more students around them. In fact, meta-analyses have shown that
              out of all the Education Production Function inputs, both factors
              within and beyond the school system, expenditures per student and
              class size have the least impact on student performance.
              Expenditures per students and class size... both factors of the
              amount of school inputs. The evidence suggests that we’re focusing
              on the wrong factors here.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Financial Analyst(Lisa Simpson), ARGUMENT: Cost</h3>
            <p>
              I would like to express that class size matters a lot in terms of
              the addition or reduction in expenditures on student resources,
              teacher salaries, and building space if class sizes were to
              increase or decrease! Some research has suggested that smaller
              class sizes lead to better student performance. However, given
              that smaller class sizes would mean an additional cost, mainly
              through hiring more teachers, this would take away the budget to
              student resources such as school supplies, club funding, and
              comfortable classroom spaces that play a part in student success.
              An analysis done by Harris in Class Size and School Size: Taking
              the Trade-Offs Seriously suggests that reducing class size would
              increase test scores by 0.05 of a standard deviation, but would
              also require $1,287 in additional expenditures per pupil.
              Therefore, reducing class size may counter student outcomes as it
              takes away the budget from essential resources. Whether class
              sizes should be made smaller or larger also depends on the school
              size as the fixed costs associated with dividing up smaller class
              sizes are more spread out, which reduces the cost per pupil. At
              the same time, if there are more students at the school, they will
              have higher operating costs to run the school. Therefore, when
              deciding whether or not to reduce class size, Ford should ensure
              that the budget for such policies implemented would not offset the
              crucial resources students need to achieve high performances.

            <h3>Superintendent(Paula Brown), ARGUMENT: TEACHER QUALITY</h3>
            <p>
              As Superintendent, when making decisions to better the overall
              performance of students, research has shown that classroom sizes
              actually have a minimal effect and what we should really be
              looking at is teacher quality. Taking an overview look at
              significant studies done in the research from the STAR Project,
              research done by Angrist and Lavy, and overall studies that
              compare western versus non-western countries, for example, there’s
              an inconclusive opinion as to whether class sizes make an impact
              but what is consistent in research - is teacher quality. For
              instance, when a reduction in class size was implemented in
              California, a 2002 study done by Jepsen and Rivkin showed that
              this caused teacher quality to decrease as a result of immediate
              hiring and therefore, caused lower student outcomes. A WoBmann and
              West study done in the same year, but across 40 countries backed
              this finding when they examined that less capable teachers
              performed well in smaller settings but not so much in a larger
              setting. Therefore, when looking at research that stated classroom
              sizes had an impact, a big contributing factor as to why that’s
              the case is in the appreciation or depreciation of teacher
              quality. Furthermore, when Hargreaves, Galton, and Pell conducted
              an experiment in 1998 observing 14 high-quality teachers and them
              in classrooms of different sizes, they measured an insignificant
              difference in student performance because they were able to adapt
              their teaching strategies to new situations. As superintendent, I
              would suggest implementing policies that eliminate less qualified
              instructors, while overall better training teachers to adapt to
              inevitable changing classroom environments.

            <h3>Outro</h3>
            <p>
              While the Ford government has not yet confirmed what the policy
              changes are going to be, it appears the change in high school
              classroom sizes has caused quite the turmoil throughout Ontario.
              With many people agreeing with the government that high school
              class sizes are an important factor in impacting student
              performance, there are also a number of people who argue that
              class size bears no impact on student performance in high school.
              The cabinet has been in discussions surrounding the effect changes
              in high school class sizes will have on test scores, the community
              environment for students, the relevance of confounding factors
              such as family, cultural, and socio-economic backgrounds, the
              financial burdens this could impose on the province, and the
              quality of our educators. The conversations appear to be
              continuing, with no final decision being determined. The question
              remains: Does class size in high school really matter? Tweet us
